#model 1 accounts for the fact that the coronavirus is most deadly if you are OLDER AND MALE
#https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02483-2#

#model 1 has an adjusted R squared of .53, which is quite high. Further, this was achieved with only 3 variables and an interaction term.
#hence, this is a great model - albeit intuitive - to predict COVID-19 deaths: counties with lower median incomes, with more men, and with more older people
#are more likely to have greater lethality. some ethnic variables are correlated with COVID-19 deaths, but they are also correlated with median income
#thus median income is a very good predictor. Surprisingly, the health-related variables (which are sample-based) weren't that good.
